## Motivations and Goals:
The motivation behind the project is to consolidate the currently scattered information and functionality in different platforms (buying second-hand products, looking for lost items, etc.) that people are looking for and allowing for a more time-efficient searching/trading/buying process. This also promotes better student solidarity.

## Problems:
Campus residents try to perform second-hand sales and find lost items by using another application or social media apps. Not having a website specifically for this purpose and trying to carry out these transactions through different applications does not always yield the desired results. Some of these result in lost items not being found or mismatches of people buying and selling second-hand books.

## Features:
1. **Buying Products:** Buyers can search products through tags and names, communicate with the seller, and bargain the price.
2. **Selling Products:** Sellers can post items with prices and selected tags.
3. **Borrowing Products:** Sellers can set the duration of the borrow, and buyers can borrow according to their desired duration.
4. **Lost Products:** Users finding lost items can add a post with censored private information. Users who lost items can post details about where and when they lost them.
5. **Private Lessons:** Users can sell private lessons through the system.
6. **Product Recommendation:** Users can ask others about product eligibility for their lectures or recommend products.
7. **Seller Rating:** Sellers have public ratings determined by users who bought from them.
8. **Roommate Searching:** Users can search for roommates in the system.
9. **Seller's Previous Sales:** Buyers can see sellers' previous sales in their account page.
10. **Course Trade:** Users can match according to their wants for a particular section or course.
11. **Direct Messaging Between Users:** Users can message each other regarding features above (buy-sell, borrowing, lost item, etc.).
12. **Account Page with Important Info:** Users need to enter their school mail and school ID for logging in and registration purposes.

## Selling Points:
Main selling points of our web app are uniting the solutions to the problems that most of the students face, being exclusive only for Bilkent University students and academic staff, being able to directly message with other users, provide a reliable seller review system.

## What Makes our Web App Interesting/Cool:
What makes our application interesting is not moving from application to application for the problems mentioned above but completing these processes successfully and doing it with a simplistic design.

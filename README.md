Motivations and Goals:

The motivation behind the project is; pivoting the currently scattered information in different platforms (buying second hand products, looking for lost items etc.) that people are looking for and allowing for a more time efficient searching/trading/buying process. Which also allows for better student solidarity. 
Features:

Buying Products ~ Buyer will be able to search products through tags of the products and products’ names and will be able to communicate with the seller and bargain the price and buy the product with the bargained price,
Selling Products ~ Seller will be able to post their item with price and selected tags,
Borrowing Products ~ Seller will be able to set duration of the borrow and buyer will be able to borrow according to their desired duration,
Lost Products ~ When a user who finds the item adds a lost item post it will censor the private information like student number and if there is an account with the same number they will get a notification. If the post has no identification info users may search that item with tags of the products and products’ names. Users who lost the item can add a lost item post where they can specify where they lost the item and when they lost it.
Private Lessons ~ Users will be able to sell private lessons through the system.
Product Recommendation ~ User’s will be able to ask other users if an item is eligible for their lectures or if they recommend a certain product for their needs.
Seller Rating ~ Every seller will have a public rating in their account page. These ratings will be determined by the users who bought products from that particular seller.
Roommate Searching ~ Users will be able to search for their roommates in the system.
Seller's Previous Sales ~ Buyers will be able to see seller’s previous sales in the sellers account page.
Course Trade ~ Users will be able to match according to their wants for a particular section or course.
Direct Messaging Between Users ~  Users will be able to message with each other if they have to communicate about the features above(buy-sell, borrowing, lost item, etc.).
Account Page with Important Info ~ Users will need to enter their school mail and school id for logging in and registration purposes.

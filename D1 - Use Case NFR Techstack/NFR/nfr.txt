NFR (Non Functional Requirements): 

Usability: The system is simple to learn and use for Bilkent University members. The user interface adopts the philosophy of being self explanatory, making it easy to understand and use. The simple-functional behavior of the system allows for the fast adaptation of the users, which makes the system advantageous over its functional competitors. The fonts, color schemes and logos used are encouraged only by elegance, which by the system’s definition is the incorporation of functionality and simplicity.  
Reliability: The system aims to support many users concurrently without any functional disruption. The system handles the occurring errors and invalid inputs from the users without corrupting the coherent flow of other software agents that the system is built upon. The system also does not withhold any influential and significant information of its users, making it safe for use.
Performance: The system has a low response time, that is, when searching, posting, viewing, the system is seamless for better user experience. The availability of the system is also considered, that is, the system’s components are operational as long as its smaller agents are available for use (such as MongoDB), which is out of the system’s control. The system supports concurrent posting and concurrent viewing of posts, that is, N number of people can view the same post and interact with it; the same thing is valid for posting a post; where N is no larger than 13000 (number of registered students in Bilkent University). 
Supportability: The system supports Windows Systems (Windows 7 and newer). The system is also eligible for including additional application domains and new technology, making it maintainable.

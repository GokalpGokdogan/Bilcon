I have developed pop-up error messages component. However, it created an error in registration page.
I have created a grid system to show products in feed.
Some pages were hard-coded, so I have created Product, Header, Feed and Navigtion Menu components.

Before The Demo-Day:
I have created Account, Details, Forgot Password, Verification and Feed(Market, Second Hand, Renting...) Pages.
I also fixed the feed pages.
